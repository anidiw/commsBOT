# Introduction
This project demostrates use of resilient microservices using NodeJS. it makes use of following 
google APIs for geocoding

moment for date formatting

superagent for http requests

slack APIs

wit APIs for natural language processing.

It creates and connects to slackBOT and depending on intent (time, location) responds to queries such as 'ani,what's the time in Berlin?', 'ani, How's the weather in Sydney?'
We can easily extend this to create other microservices.
